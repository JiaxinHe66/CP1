One-sentence summary of your project goes here; then fill out each of the following sections.

# Summary
I use Arduino to build my project. I mainly used two dc motors and a sensor. The sensor is an ultrasonic sensor that can trigger the bubble machine when someone approaches. 

# Component Parts
inputs: An ultrasonic sensor
outputs: two dc motors
